# Memory Plant

I created **Memory Plant**, an AI-powered journaling app that helps users organize their personal stories from diary entries.  
Users keep their “Memory Plant” factory running by writing daily journals, while the AI “Memory Curator” summarizes entries and serves as a conversational partner.  
Each month, the app generates a personalized summary scrapbook and offers tailored suggestions based on users’ recorded memories.
